# <Social Network API>

## Description

In this project, I created my own social network using mongoDB and mongoose. This noSQL database would allow someone to create a profile, post their thoughts, have reactions/comments to other people's thoughts as well as add friends. You can also delete, or update users, and thoughts in addition to deleting a reaction. This api is just the start/ back end of a potential social networking website, and I can see how using mongoDB and mongoose could be very useful in doing something like this. 


## Installation

To install this API locally, you can run 
```
npm i
```

## Usage

To use this API, after installing all the required packages, you can run 
```
npm run start
```

Once the server has started, you are able to make all the Create, Read, Update, and Delete requests. Examples of all the requests you can make are shown in this video [Social Network API Walkthough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYN1ijqTpALBM3WGr1bQBp53kfJQrHp3/view). This is a good start to a backend for a social network. With this API you can add, delete, update, or view a single user, you can view all users, you can add, delete, update, or view a single "thought", you can view all "thoughts", you can add or delete friends, and finally you can add or delete "reactions" to someones "thought".
